Here’s a well-structured GitHub README for your Gateway Stream project based on the files and functionality I’ve seen so far. It’s concise, informative, and follows common conventions to help users understand, install, and contribute to your project. I’ll assume this is a web application for event streaming and ticket purchasing, consistent with the pages like Event Organiser, Contact Us, and FAQ.

### Notes
- **Customization**: Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username in the clone URL.
- **Logo**: Assumes `Assets/images/logo.png` exists; update the path if it’s different.
- **License**: I’ve suggested MIT as a common open-source license—add a `LICENSE` file if you choose this, or specify your preferred license.
- **Social Links**: Update the `#` placeholders with real URLs if available.
- **Particles.js**: Noted as optional since FAQ doesn’t use it, but others do—clarify if it’s site-wide.
